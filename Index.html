        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>Food is essential for survival. It provides energy and nourishment to our bodies. There are many types of
          food, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and meats. Each type of food contains different nutrients that our
          bodies need to stay healthy. Eating a balanced diet is important to ensure we get all the nutrients we need.
          Some people have dietary restrictions due to allergies or health conditions, so they must be careful about
          what they eat. Food can also be a source of enjoyment and comfort, as we often gather with friends and family
          to share meals and create memories together. Overall, food plays a vital role in our lives.</p>
